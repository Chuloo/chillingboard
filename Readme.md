# Live Chilling-Board

This is just a fun demo to test Pusher and Vue.

## Installation
Clone or download the repo to your machine.
Run:

```js
npm install
```

This installs all dependencies required.

Go to (Pusher)[https://pusher.com] to create an account, create an app afterwards to obtain pusher credentials required for your app.

Input the credential values in the cred_sample.js file. Remember to change the path to the credential in the server.js file.
